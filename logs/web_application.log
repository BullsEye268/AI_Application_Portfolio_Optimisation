2025-04-29 14:18:59 - hyperopt.fmin - ERROR - job exception: Changing param values is not allowed. Param with key='weight_AAPL' was already logged with value='0.10439029629697173' for run ID='620680287b2742fd9c4d22b43f19ad21'. Attempted logging new value '0.08373132490488962'.

The cause of this error is typically due to repeated calls
to an individual run_id event logging.

Incorrect Example:
---------------------------------------
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("depth", 3)
    mlflow.log_param("depth", 5)
---------------------------------------

Which will throw an MlflowException for overwriting a
logged parameter.

Correct Example:
---------------------------------------
with mlflow.start_run():
    with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
        mlflow.log_param("depth", 3)
    with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
        mlflow.log_param("depth", 5)
---------------------------------------

Which will create a new nested run for each individual
model and prevent parameter key collisions within the
tracking store.
